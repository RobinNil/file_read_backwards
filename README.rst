Memory efficient way of reading files line-by-line from the end of file


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://file-read-backwards.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

This package is for reading file backward line by line as unicode in a memory efficient manner for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.

It currently supports ascii, latin-1, and utf-8 encodings.

It supports "\\r", "\\r\\n", and "\\n" as new lines.

Usage Examples
--------------

Another example using `python3.11`::

    from file_read_backwards import FileReadBackwards

    with FileReadBackwards("/tmp/file", encoding="utf-8") as frb:

        # getting lines by lines starting from the last line up
        for l in frb:
            print(l)


Another way to consume the file is via `readline()`, in `python3.11`::

    from file_read_backwards import FileReadBackwards

    with FileReadBackwards("/tmp/file", encoding="utf-8") as frb:

        while True:
            l = frb.readline()
            if not l:
                break
            print(l, end="")
